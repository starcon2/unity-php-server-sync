Using php and mysql combo as a unity server(Positions, usernames, etc)


Mostly as a proof of concept, this will use php to fetch player positions and usernames from a database(mysql). Php and mysql arent super well-sutied for this, but i do have a decent proof of concept/project going here!

To use this import the database in the files (phpunity.sql) and then go in each php file and change $conn to your mysql information.

This has all of the server-side(php/mysql) files, I'm putting all the c#/unity project files on a google drive as github's online uploader does not let me upload all of the project files!

Then go and change the ip in all of the .cs scripts(assets, for the project/unity project)

Best of luck to you!
(ps: use this for whatever you want!)
